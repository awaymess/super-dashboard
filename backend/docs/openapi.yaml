    Integrated Sports Betting Analytics & Stock Monitoring Platform API.
    
    This is the backend API for Super Dashboard, providing health checks,
    authentication, betting, stock monitoring, and paper trading endpoints.
    
    ## Health Endpoints
    - `/health` - Basic health check
    - `/health/ready` - Readiness check (includes dependency checks)
    - `/health/live` - Liveness check for Kubernetes probes
    
    ## API v1 Endpoints
    All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.
    
    ## Authentication
    Most endpoints require JWT Bearer token authentication.
    Use `/api/v1/auth/login` to obtain tokens.
